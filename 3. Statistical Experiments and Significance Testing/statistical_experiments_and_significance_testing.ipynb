    "# 3. Statistical Experiments and Significance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Design of experiments is a cornerstone of the practice of statistics, with applications in virtually all areas of research. The goal is to design an experiment in order to confirm or reject a hypothesis. Data scientists often need to conduct continual experiments, particularly regarding user interface and product marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "An A/B test is an experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments, products, prcedures, or the like is superior. Often one of the two treatments is the standard existing treatment, or no treatment. If a standard (or no) treatment is used, it is called _control_. A typical hypothesis is that a new treatment is better than the control.\n",

    "#### Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests, also called _significance tests_, are ubiquitous in the traditional statistical analysis of published research. Their purpose is to help you to learn whether random chance might be responsible for an observed effect.\n",

    "#### The Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests use the following logic: \"Given the human tendency to react to unusual but random behavior and interpret it as something meaningful and real, in our experiments we will require proof that the difference between groups is more extreme than what chance might reasonably produce.\" This involves a baseline assumption that the treatments are equivalent, and any difference between the groups is due tochance. This baseline assumption is termed the _null hypothesis_. Our hope, then is that we can in fact prove the null hypothesis _wrong_ and show that outcomes for groups A and B are more different than what chance might produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests by their nature involve not just a null hypothesis but also an offsetting alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NULL = \"no difference between means of group A and B\"; alternative = \"A is different from B\"\n",
    "* NULL = \"A <= B\"; alternative = \"A > B\"\n",
    "* NULL = \"B is not X% greater then A\"; alternative = \"B is X% greater than A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the null and alternative hypothesis must account for all possibilities. The nature of the null hypothesis determines the structure of the hypothesis test."
