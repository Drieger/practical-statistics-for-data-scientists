    "# 3. Statistical Experiments and Significance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Design of experiments is a cornerstone of the practice of statistics, with applications in virtually all areas of research. The goal is to design an experiment in order to confirm or reject a hypothesis. Data scientists often need to conduct continual experiments, particularly regarding user interface and product marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "An A/B test is an experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments, products, prcedures, or the like is superior. Often one of the two treatments is the standard existing treatment, or no treatment. If a standard (or no) treatment is used, it is called _control_. A typical hypothesis is that a new treatment is better than the control.\n",
